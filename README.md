# bookbot

BookBot is my first [Boot.dev](https://www.boot.dev) project!# bookbot
Making a bookbot for boot.dev

## This does the following:

1. It runs from the root folder of the project.
2. If not exactly 2 arguments are given it exits with exit code 1 and tells you how to run it.
3. It takes a book from a given path, it turns it into one large string, the string gets split up in individual words, the words are counted and the resulting count is printed to the terminal.
4. It counts individual letters and displays them with their respective counts. Non-alphabetic characters are ignored.
